This code is used on a Raspberry Pi Uno microcontroller, in conjunction with the VESC tool to control 2 Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs), to regulate supplied torque to each driving wheel via an "Electronic Differential System", also known as torque vectoring. The code allows the EDS to regulate the torque based on input from a RC car handheld radio controller, changing the speed of the wheel on either side of the vehicle, which could potentially improve the vehicleâ€™s traction, minimising power losses due to rotational slip from the wheels
